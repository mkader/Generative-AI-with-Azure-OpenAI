## What is generative AI?
* AI imitates human behavior by using ML to interact with the environment and execute tasks without explicit directions on what to output.
* Generative AI describes a category of capabilities within AI that create original content. People typically interact with generative AI that has been built into chat applications. One popular example of such an application is ChatGPT, a chatbot created by OpenAI, an AI research company that partners closely with Microsoft.

* Image generation - Some generative AI applications can interpret a natural language request and generate an appropriate image. For example, you might submit a request like "Create an image of an elephant eating a burger".

* Code generation - Some generative AI applications are designed to help software developers write code. For example, you could submit a request like "Show me how to code a game of tic-tac-toe with Python" and generate the following response:
